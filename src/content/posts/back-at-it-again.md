# Back at it again

After many years of not blogging, I'm back at it again. I've got some writing that others might find interesting and so I've revamped my website to make it easier to write and publish. Static site generators have come a long way, and [React](https://react.dev) with [Astro](https://astro.build) has made it easier to build interactive websites that let you do interesting things. I'm in the process of moving internationally while finding a new job, so my plan is to write about databases with database adjacent topics thrown in there.

So, please enjoy!
