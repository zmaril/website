# About

Hello, I'm Zack Maril and this is my personal website. I am an American living in Washington, DC and I will soon be moving to Salzburg, Austria. I have a wide range of interests including [chess](https://www.schachzeit.com/), [dancing](https://zacksdancelab.com/), cooking, databases, system realiability engineering, learning languages and [the political economy of web crawling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dominates.html). I am currently learning German and Zouk.

You can contact me via email at [zack@zacharymaril.com](mailto:zack@zacharymaril.com) or via twitter at [@zackmaril](https://twitter.com/zackmaril). I'll put a resume up here soon as well.
