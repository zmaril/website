# Zack's Personal Website

My personal website built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) through the use of the [fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) template.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. To edit your blog locally, clone your repository, run `pnpm install` AND `pnpm add sharp` to install dependencies.
   - Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) `npm install -g pnpm` if you haven't.
2. Edit the config file `src/config.ts` to customize your blog.
3. Run `pnpm new-post <filename>` to create a new post and edit it in `src/content/posts/`.
4. `pnpm preview`
